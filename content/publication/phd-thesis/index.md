abstract: "Attention allows us to focus on what is relevant and to ignore what is
not. While we call upon attention at every waking moment, it is not
static: we cannot sustain attention indefinitely, and often fall prey to
distractions. This PhD thesis is a study of the short-term
*neuroplasticity* of attentional processes: how susceptible is attention
to change, and what processes in the brain (*neuro*-) give rise to
changes in attention (-*plasticity*)? In Chapters 2–5, I examined
whether attention can be improved with electrical stimulation of the
brain, in the form of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).
Previous studies that attempted to use tDCS to enhance attention have
yielded promising, but inconsistent results (reviewed in Chapter 2). My
attempt to enhance *spatial* attention with tDCS (Chapter 3) was
unsuccessful, as stimulation of the frontal eye fields did not lead to
changes in eye movements. Applying tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex also did not enhance *temporal* attention (Chapters 4 and 5), as
participants’ performance on an attentional blink task remained
unchanged. In Chapter 6, I investigated the opposite effect: decreases
in attention, when attention has to be *sustained* for a long time.
Using EEG, I tracked whether similar decreases occurred in different
attention-related signals in the brain. tDCS may one day be used to
counteract these declines, or to relieve other deficits in attention.
However, barring a deeper understanding of the technique and more
large-scale studies of its efficacy, such practical applications of tDCS
are not yet feasible.
