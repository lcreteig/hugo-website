I am a data scientist and post-doctoral researcher at the [Central Diagnostic Laboratory](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl/ziekenhuis/centraal-diagnostisch-laboratorium) of the University Medical Center Utrecht, which conducts all laboratory tests (e.g. blood samples) in the hospital. My work focuses on using such data collected during routine care to make diagnostic prediction models. I am also interested in text mining to extract and leverage information from the electronic health record.

Before switching to data science in the medical domain, I was a PhD student in the [Cognition and Plasticity lab](https://www.heleenslagter.com/) of Prof. Heleen Slagter, funded by an NWO Research Talent grant. My PhD research focused on improving  attention through electrical stimulation of the brain. During my PhD I became a strong supporter of open science principles, and I still strive to make my work as transparent and reproducible as possible.
