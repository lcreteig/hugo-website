As anyone will attest after a long day of work, sustaining attention is mentally fatiguing and cannot be done indefinitely. But, we know surprisingly little about why this is actually the case. In this project, I attempted to shed more light on fluctuations in sustained attention by conducting an experiment on the *vigilance decrement*.

The vigilance decrement (also known as the time-on-task effect) is observed when people are tasked to monitor incoming information and detect rare, but critical signals. This is surprisingly effortful, and performance on such tasks already starts to decrease after only a few minutes. The vigilance decrement is robust and has been studied for decades, starting from interests in the performance of military radar operators. Decrements in sustained attention also loom in many other situations, including long stretches of driving, traffic control, or quality inspection. 

There remains considerable debate on the ultimate cause of the vigilance decrement: does performance decrease due to true exhaustion, or do people instead succumb to the likes of boredom, mind wandering, or decreasing motivation towards the task? I attempted to address these issues by tracking changes in attention-related brain activity during performance of a vigilance task, using electro-encephalography (EEG; see also [my other studies](../eeg-attention) of attention with EEG).
