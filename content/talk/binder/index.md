abstract: "Introduction to the use of [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/), which allows others to run your code from the comfort of their web browser. This talk compares Binder with other frameworks to share computational environments, such as configuration files or virtual machines. It also includes a link to an example R-based research project of mine where I used Binder, as well as links examples of others and basic tutorials."
